Q.  Study opendir(), readdir() and closedir(). Write short notes on them.

A.  i)      opendir()   :   The opendir() function  opens a directory stream corresponding to the
                            directory name, and returns a pointer(or NULL in case of error) to the directory stream(DIR pointer).   
                            The stream is positioned at the first entry in the directory.
    
    ii)     readdir()   :   The readdir() function returns a pointer to a dirent structure representing 
                            the next directory entry in the directory stream pointed to by DIR pointer. 
                            It returns NULL on reaching the end of the directory stream or an error occurred.
    
    iii)    closedir()  :   The closedir() function closes the directory stream associated with DIR pointer.  
                            A successful call to closedir() also closes the underlying file descriptor associated with DIR pointer.  
                            The directory stream descriptor DIR pointer is not available after this call.
