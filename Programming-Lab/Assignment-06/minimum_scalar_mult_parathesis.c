/*
    • Take a sequence of n matrices with dimensions p0xp1, p1xp2, ..., pn-
    1xpn. Put parenthesis in the sequence in all possible ways, each of

    which specifies the order of matrix multiplication. For example, if
    there are 4 matrices A1, A2, A3, A4, and the parenthesis is put as A1
    ((A2 A3) A4), then the order of multiplication is: first multiply A2 and
    A3, then multiply this result with A4, and finally multiply A1 with the
    last result.

    Take n=4

    • In this assignment, you have to find out the final matrix and number of
    scalar multiplications for each way of multiplication, then to verify if
    matrix multiplication is associative. In addition to this, output the way
    of putting parenthesis for which the number of scalar multiplications is
    minimum.
